    question: "What‚Äôs your story, Vishnu üë®‚Äçüíª? ",
    answer:
      "I‚Äôm a BTech CSE student at COEP Pune, but my journey wasn‚Äôt a straight path. I initially pursued petrochemical engineering, but my passion for coding and technology led me to switch to computer science. During my diploma, I discovered my love for programming and never looked back.Now, I‚Äôm focused on AI, DSA, and web development, constantly learning and growing. Though I had to leave behind volleyball, a sport I cherished since childhood, I‚Äôve found new excitement in solving complex problems and building innovative solutions. Passion over pressure‚Äîthat‚Äôs my mantra! üöÄüí°",
  },
  {
    question: "Why did you switch from Petrochemical to Computer Science? üîÑüí°? ",
    answer:
      "I initially chose petrochemical engineering based on external advice rather than my own passion. But as I studied, I realized that my heart wasn‚Äôt in it. At the same time, I started coding and enjoyed it far more than my core subjects. That‚Äôs when I knew I had to switch and pursue what truly excited me.",
  },
  {
    question: "How did you get into COEP üéìüèÜ? ",
    answer:
      "When I decided to transition into computer science, I researched top colleges and set COEP as my first preference and VJTI as my second. When the provisional merit list was released, I was ranked 4th in all of Maharashtra! It was a proud moment for my family, but for me, it was bittersweet‚ÄîI had to sacrifice my love for volleyball to focus on my career.",
  },
  {
    question: "What was the biggest challenge during your transitionü§î?",
    answer:
      "The biggest challenge was catching up with the technical knowledge that other computer science students already had. I had to put in extra effort to learn DSA, web development, and AI while balancing my coursework. It was tough, but I pushed through and cleared all my subjects with a solid CGPA of 8.0üöÄ.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you miss volleyballüèêüíô?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Volleyball was a huge part of my life, and stepping away from it was difficult. But I believe sacrifices are necessary to achieve greater goals. While I may not play competitively anymore, the sport has instilled in me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance‚Äîqualities that help me in my tech journey.",
  },
  {
    question: "What‚Äôs the biggest lesson you‚Äôve learned from this experienceüéØ?",
    answer:
      "Always choose what truly interests you, not what others suggest. Your career is something you‚Äôll work on for years, so it should be something you‚Äôre passionate about. If you follow external advice without considering your own interests, you might end up regretting it. ü§ùüìö",
  },
  {
    question: "Got any advice for young tech enthusiasts üí°?",
    answer:
      "Start small but dream big! Dive into DSA, try building real-world projects, and never stop exploring new tech. And most importantly, have fun with it. Coding is like playing a game. üéÆüíª",
  },
  {
    question: "What‚Äôs been the biggest challenge in switching fields? ü§î?",
    answer:
      "Adapting to a completely new way of thinking! Moving from chemical equations to coding logic wasn‚Äôt easy, but persistence, curiosity, and a love for problem-solving helped me bridge the gap.üîßüîç",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you deal with coding burnout ü§Øüî• ?",
    answer:
      "I take breaks and step away from the screen. A walk, a playing FreeFire, or just talking with my family helps me reset. Balance is the secret sauce. üß†üçÉ",
  },
  {
    question: "What‚Äôs next for you üöÄ‚ú®? ",
    answer:
      "More learning, more projects, and maybe some new skills like AI. The world‚Äôs full of possibilities, and I‚Äôm just getting started. Watch out! üí•‚ú®",
